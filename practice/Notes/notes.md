### What is SVG ?

#### Scalable Vector Graphic is like HTML but for 2D graphic 
#### PNG AND JPG use grids of tiny pixels to create images. Images become grainy once you zoom in
#### SVG can be scaled to any size without losing any resolution

### Why can I see something ? 
#### Prob because forget to adjust the height and widgth. Example below

        width: 30px;  /* or any other size you want */
        height: auto;
    }
```
